# embedded-system-project

This is a project I did with a classmate during my third year at my engineering school.
The goal was to control a small car with our phone.

*Electronic part (with the software Altium):
1) positionning the components on our printed circuit board (PCB);
2) PCB routing;
3) printing of the card.

*Programming part:
1) coding our card with SystemWorkbench for STM32;
2) coding an app to control the car with our phone.

To program our PCB, we used a state machine :


The following activity diagram shows how the phone app works:
